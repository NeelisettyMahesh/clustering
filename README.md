# K-Means Clustering on Mall Customers Dataset

## Objective
Apply K-Means clustering to group customers based on their annual income and spending score.

## Dataset
- **File:** Mall_Customers.csv
- **Features Used:** Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1-100)

## Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Steps
1. Load dataset and select relevant features.
2. Use Elbow Method to choose optimal number of clusters.
3. Fit KMeans and assign cluster labels.
4. Visualize clusters and centroids.
5. Evaluate using Silhouette Score.

## Results
- **K=5** chosen using the Elbow Method.
- Visualized clusters using Seaborn.
- Silhouette Score printed for evaluation.
